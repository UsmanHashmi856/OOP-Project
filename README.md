# Zombie-Land: A 2D Zombie Survival Game

## Overview

"Zombie-Land" is a 2D survival game development project focused on demonstrating the effective application of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles. Players will navigate a challenging environment, strategically fend off hordes of zombies, and strive for survival. This project aims to showcase the power of OOP in creating dynamic and engaging game mechanics within a captivating 2D experience.

## 1. Introduction

### Background

This project explores game development as a practical avenue for applying Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts. By creating an interactive 2D game, we aim to move beyond theoretical understanding and demonstrate how OOP can lead to well-structured, maintainable, and extensible game code. The game will incorporate elements of action, strategy, and survival to provide an engaging player experience.

### Problem Statement

Many introductory game development attempts often lack a clear and meaningful implementation of OOP principles. This project directly addresses this challenge by developing a game specifically designed to showcase core OOP features such as inheritance, polymorphism, encapsulation, and abstraction in a tangible way.

### Objectives

* Build an interactive 2D zombie survival game with increasing difficulty as the player progresses.
* Clearly showcase the implementation of fundamental OOP principles within the core game mechanics.
* Demonstrate key OOP concepts including class hierarchies for game entities, effective player-zombie interaction models, and seamless Graphical User Interface (GUI) integration.

## 2. Scope of the Project

### Inclusions

* Development of a fully playable 2D survival game where the player must defend against relentless zombie hordes.
* Implementation of core game mechanics such as smooth player movement, challenging zombie Artificial Intelligence (AI), and intuitive shooting mechanics.
* A robust health and score tracking system to provide feedback and progression.
* A user-friendly Graphical User Interface (GUI) built using the SFML (Simple and Fast Multimedia Library).
* A basic level progression system to introduce increasing challenges and potentially new environments.

### Exclusions

* Implementation of complex 3D graphics or advanced physics simulations.
* Development of multiplayer or networked gameplay functionalities.
* Integration of sophisticated sound effects or highly detailed graphical assets.

## 3. Project Description

### Overview

"Zombie Survival Chronicles" immerses players in a 2D environment where survival hinges on their ability to navigate, evade, and combat relentless zombies using available weaponry. The game's architecture will heavily leverage OOP principles. Inheritance will be used to create a hierarchy of player and enemy classes, allowing for varied behaviors and attributes. Encapsulation will ensure the integrity of critical systems like player health and score management. Polymorphism will enable the implementation of diverse weapon types with unique functionalities.

### Technical Requirements

* **Programming Language:** C++
* **Tools:** Microsoft Visual Studio or Visual Studio Code, Dev-C++
* **Graphics Library:** SFML (Simple and Fast Multimedia Library)
* **Version Control:** Git and GitHub

### Project Phases

1.  **Research:** Thoroughly study the SFML library and design the fundamental architecture of the game.
2.  **Planning:** Develop a detailed class diagram outlining the relationships between game entities and define the core game mechanics.
3.  **Design:** Implement the basic Graphical User Interface (GUI) elements and the foundational game components (e.g., game loop, basic rendering).
4.  **Implementation:** Code the core game logic, focusing on the integration and demonstration of key OOP principles throughout the development process.

## 4. Methodology

### Approach

* We will adopt an iterative development approach, focusing on building core functionalities incrementally and testing frequently.
* Regular and thorough testing will be conducted throughout the development process to ensure game stability and functional correctness.
* The project work will be divided into modular tasks, allowing each team member to focus on specific areas of development (e.g., player controls, zombie AI, scoring system).

### Team Responsibilities

* **Member 1 (Haris Ali):** Primarily responsible for researching and implementing player movement mechanics and the initial Graphical User Interface (GUI).
* **Member 2 (Usman Hashmi):** Primarily responsible for developing the Artificial Intelligence (AI) for the zombie characters and implementing the logic for player-zombie interactions.
* **Member 3 (Abdul Hadi Kashif):** Primarily responsible for integrating the scoring system, implementing health tracking for the player, and conducting comprehensive testing of the game.

## 5. Expected Outcomes

### Deliverables

* A fully functional 2D zombie survival game executable.
* A concise technical report detailing how Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles were applied in the design and implementation of the game's core mechanics.
* Clear and easy-to-follow user instructions explaining how to play the developed game.

### Relevance

* This project serves as a practical demonstration of our programming skills in a fun and engaging context.
* It reinforces our understanding and application of fundamental Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles through a real-world development scenario.
* The project provides a solid foundation for further exploration and advancement in the field of game development.
